Krusader-2.3.0-beta1 "New Horizons"
===================================
We are pleased to announce a new version of the Krusader file manager. As many
new features have been added to the development version, we decided to
skip the 2.2 cycle entirely.

Being a beta release we ask you to provide bug reports, feedback and
patches to make the upcoming stable as solid as possible.

The highlights of this release are:

- QuickFilter - Default shortcut: CTRL+I
- Actions: Back/Forward in history
- Option: Show directories first
- Selection dialog option: Apply selection to directories
- Filter option: Apply filter to directories

Read SVNNEWS for detailed information about the new features and the
INSTALL file for installation instructions.

Notice: if you've got bugs to report, please do so using Krusader's
        website, and not using KDE's bugzilla (bugs.kde.org).

            as always, enjoy
                 Krusader Krew.
