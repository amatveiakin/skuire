Fix regressions:
- An in-place renamed file temporary disappears from the view.
- Files to be removed are shown in random order in the deletion confirmation dialog (they were sorted according to current sort settings earlier).
- List of files copied by Ctrl+C in unsorted (may be related to the previous bug).
- The new-created folder is not focused.
- When an archive is exited (by ".." or a backspace key) there is no more current item (the archive should become the current item, as a folder does).
