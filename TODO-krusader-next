new source tree layout:

    modules/

Fix regressions:
------------------
- An in-place renamed file temporary disappears from the view.
- Files to be removed are shown in random order in the deletion confirmation dialog (they were sorted according to current sort settings earlier).
- List of files copied by Ctrl+C is unsorted (may be related to the previous bug).
- The new-created folder is not focused.
- When an archive is exited (by ".." or a backspace key) there is no more current item (the archive should become the current item, as a folder does).
- after gui-restart several actions are not connected anymore to KrusaderView
- symlinks to dirs not recognized as dirs ?
- autoresize columns is broken
- ".." isn't colored as dir
- bug in search result: dirs not fully recognized


FIXME in:
------------------
VFS::copy()
TerminalDock::applyShortcuts(QKeyEvent * ke)
MediaButton::mount(QString udi, bool open, bool newtab)
listpanel.cpp (filter settings don't persist when changing view type)
(...)
